## Notes
Encounter some difficulties to make my first queries and mutations type. 
To make a request in GraphiQL to create user using bcrypt gem to authenticate, here's my solution: 
```ruby
mutation {
	createUser(
	name: "Renaud",
	authProvider: {
		credentials: {
			email: "reno@test.com",
			password: "password"
		}
	}
	)	{
		id
		name
		email
	}
}
````

==BUG== 
When adding a `def all_users` method in `QueryType` it creates an error. 
```shell
TypeError: Cannot read property 'types' of undefined
    at buildClientSchema (http://localhost:3000/assets/graphiql/rails/application.debug-302d2d018661e60251eb98c333754c95eb06ce1ff919c0505ec40aafde0d2554.js:34100:72)

```

I can't use Graphiql anymore 
==FIX== 


## Types

## Mutations
> Mutations are a way for the client to talk to the server whenever it needs an operation that isnâ€™t just about fetching data.

`Mutation_type.rb` is a the placeholder for all GraphQL mutations. 

==Create a new mutation file for a each new method ?==
